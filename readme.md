```

## Running
The project can be run by using Docker:

```
It is important that when stopping the project you should use:

## Configurations
There are some configurations that should be checked before deploying the program to any
non-dev environments. The file `env.properties` in the `nha-init` folder needs to be updated
with username and passwords.  
To populate the database or recover a database dump, simply add it to the `nha-db` folder as a 
.sql file. It will automatically be run by MySQL at startup, in alphabetical order.
If you have a database dump it might be a good idea to remove the `_populateTables.sql` file.  
When the database starts up it will mirror the `/var/lib/mysql/` from the docker container to
a `mysql-storage` folder locally. **Be aware removing this folder will reset the database.**  

## Dump or restore database
To dump or restore the database from Docker run:
```
# Backup
docker exec nha-db /usr/bin/mysqldump -u root --password=ROOT_PW DATABASE > backup.sql

# Restore
cat backup.sql | docker exec -i nha-db /usr/bin/mysql -u root --password=ROOT_PW DATABASE
```

Where DATABASE is the database you want to restore or dump and ROOT_PW is the root password set
in `env.properties`.
